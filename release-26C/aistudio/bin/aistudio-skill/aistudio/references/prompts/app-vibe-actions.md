# Actions (App Builder)

This section defines how **actions** work in the Agentic App Framework app specification, and how to safely add/modify/delete them.

## What an action is

An action is an app-defined workflow that can be invoked by runtime output (e.g. `ora.Invoke("someActionCode", payload)`), and executes a sequence of **steps**.

Actions live at:

- `appConfig.actions: Action[]`

Each action has:

- `id` (string, required): stable internal identifier.
- `code?` (string): the name used by `ora.Invoke("...")` to find the action. **Do not ask the user to provide this.** In App Builder, action codes should be auto-generated and treated as stable identifiers.
- `displayName?` (string): user-facing label.
- `description?` (string): optional description.
- `events?`: map of event name → steps list. Today the main event is `onInvoke`.

Most action editing focuses on the stored field:

- `events.onInvoke: ActionSteps[]`

Tooling note:

- The stored schema field is `events.onInvoke`.
- The preferred tool argument is `onInvokeSteps`.
- Compatibility alias: the tools also accept `events.onInvoke` when mirroring the persisted schema directly.
- For `do-add-action`, the initial steps payload must be an array.
- For `do-modify-action`, the steps payload may be either:
  - an array (replace), or
  - `{ mode: "append" | "upsert" | "replace", steps: [...] }`

Each step has:

- `id` (string, required): stable step identifier.
- `type` (string, required): one of the supported step types.
- `params` (object): step parameters (strings, booleans, string arrays).

## Supported step types (events.onInvoke)

These are the supported `step.type` values and their parameters:

1) `preserveAction`
   - Params: none
   - Meaning: keep the originating UI action visible after running.

2) `navigateToAgenticApp`
   - Params:
     - `appCode` (string, required)
     - `passPayloadAsContext` (boolean)
     - `context` (string)
   - Meaning: navigate to another agentic app; optionally pass the invoke payload as app context.
   - Editor behavior:
     - when `passPayloadAsContext: true`, the editor hides `context`; omit it.

3) `agentCommand`
   - Params:
     - `sendPayloadAsContext` (boolean)
     - `command` (string)
     - `doNotAutoRefresh` (boolean)
   - Meaning: send a command to an agent; optionally use the invoke payload as context; optionally suppress auto-refresh.
   - Rule:
     - If the corresponding `ora.Invoke(...)` includes a payload/context, set `sendPayloadAsContext: true` and omit `command`.
     - If the corresponding `ora.Invoke("actionCode")` has NO payload/context, do NOT set `sendPayloadAsContext: true`; instead provide a concrete `command` string on the step.
   - Editor behavior:
     - when `sendPayloadAsContext: true`, the editor hides `command`; omit it.

4) `refreshAgents`
   - Params:
     - `agentCodes` (string[], optional)
     - `refreshPriorityActions` (boolean)
     - `refreshSummary` (boolean)
   - Meaning: refresh one or more agents by agent **code**; optionally also refresh their priority actions and rebuild the summary from only those selected agents.

5) `showMedia`
   - Params:
     - `title` (string)
     - `usePayloadAsUrl` (boolean)
     - `src` (string)
   - Meaning: show media in the UI; optionally use the invoke payload as the URL.
   - Editor behavior:
     - when `usePayloadAsUrl: true`, the editor hides `src`; omit it.

6) `switchAppContext`
   - Params:
     - `usePayloadAsContext` (boolean)
     - `context` (string)
     - `refreshApp` (boolean)
   - Meaning: update the app context; optionally refresh the app afterwards.
   - Editor behavior:
     - when `usePayloadAsContext: true`, the editor hides `context`; omit it.

7) `editArtifact`
   - Params: none.
   - Invoke payload shape:
     - `id` (stable editor instance id)
     - `type` (`pdf` | `richText` | `structuredRichText` | `text` | `url`)
     - optional `title`
     - optional `url` (PDF or URL artifact)
     - optional `mediaType` (`binary` | `base64`) for PDF URLs
     - optional `useApplicationSecurity` (`true` for PDF URLs that require application security credentials)
     - optional `value` (for `text` / `richText`)
     - optional `sections` (for `structuredRichText`): array of `{ name, locked, text }`
     - optional `highlightText`
     - optional `commitText`
     - optional `metadata` (arbitrary JSON; passed back unchanged on commit)
     - optional `parameters`: array of `{ id, type: "text", defaultValue, displayName? }`
     - only `type: "text"` is currently supported for parameters
     - do not invent `parameters`; only include them when they are explicitly specified in the user request or prompt instructions
     - `displayName` is optional and only affects the viewer label
   - `type: "url"` is always read-only and renders the supplied `url` in an iframe.
   - Commit return shape for text / richText edits:
     - `<oraFormSubmit id="{id-or-artifact}">{"newValue":"...","parameters":[{"id":"...","value":"..."}],"metadata":{...}}</oraFormSubmit>`
     - `artifactPreviewWidget` saves include `metadata.artifactId` so the workflow can identify which preview item was edited.
   - `structuredRichText` currently opens in the rich text editor by flattening all section `text` values top-to-bottom into one editable document.
   - When the editor was opened from `artifactPreviewWidget`, the app updates the matching preview card in place after save.
   - Meaning: agent-driven artifact editing behavior; configure the widget/insight invoke payload, not step params.

## Safety rules

- `action.code` should be stable; changing it can break existing `ora.Invoke("code")` references in prompts/insights.
- Do not ask the user for `action.code`. Prefer auto-generated action codes.
- Step ids should be stable; only replace a step id if the user explicitly wants a “new” step.
- Be careful with steps list editing:
  - Replacing `events.onInvoke` overwrites the entire action flow.
  - Prefer “append/upsert” behaviors when the user asked to add a step/section.

## When to use which tool

- Inspect an action: fetch by id.
- Add an action: create an entry in `appConfig.actions`.
- Modify an action: patch an existing entry (including step edits).
- Remove an action: remove an entry from `appConfig.actions`.

## Default behavior (don’t ask for steps)

When the user requests behavior that clearly implies an action (e.g. “when the user clicks…”, “add a button that…”, “invoke an action that…”), and you can infer a safe implementation, you should:

1) Create/modify the action with the needed `onInvokeSteps` immediately (this writes the stored field `events.onInvoke`).
2) Wire the widget/insight to call the action via `ora.Invoke(...)`.

Do NOT ask the user to design step-by-step action flows when the intent is clear. Only ask a clarifying question when:

- The requested behavior is ambiguous (multiple plausible step sequences), or
- It is high-stakes / has side effects (navigation, context switching, external links), or
- Required information is missing (e.g. target `appCode` for `navigateToAgenticApp`).

### Common inferred action patterns

- “Click an item to ask the same agent for details about that item”:
  - Add an action with a single `agentCommand` step using `sendPayloadAsContext: true`.
  - Ensure the `ora.Invoke("actionCode", payload)` payload includes the instruction and the item identifier(s), because `command` is ignored in payload-as-context mode.
