# AI Studio Prompt References

Read these files directly from the bundled skill when artifact authoring guidance is needed.
Load only the prompt files relevant to the current task.
The packaged CLI is `scripts/aistudio.js`; keep cwd at the project root and run commands by script path, for example `node .agents/skills/aistudio/scripts/aistudio.js <command> ...`. Treat `aistudio <command>` examples as shorthand, do not search PATH for a global executable, and run `init` only when the user explicitly asks to initialize or scaffold a blank project.
For workflow node creation or modification, read `workflow-node-prompts/index.md` and then the relevant node prompt files.
For workflow test authoring, read `workflow-test-authoring.md`.
For app test authoring after app creation or material app edits, read `app-test-authoring.md`.
For app-backed workflow work, read the workflow references plus the app references needed for the app-stage contract.
For Agentic App sample references, read `resources/app-samples/index.md` before opening individual sample files.
