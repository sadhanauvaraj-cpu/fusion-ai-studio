### BO Function

- Backend `type`: `BO_FUNCTION`
- **Metadata:** `businessObjectCode` (selected object), `functionName` (selected function/tool), `processJson` (boolean; defaults to `true`, only persists `false`)
- **Inputs:** One input per token parameter (names from the selected function definition)
- **Output:** `outputSpecification` (editable JSON schema string)

#### Structure

- A valid `BO_FUNCTION` node must include:
  - `metadata.businessObjectCode`
  - `metadata.functionName`
  - outer `outcomes.success`
- `family` and `product` are selection filters in the editor. They help the user choose a business object, but they are not part of the persisted `BO_FUNCTION` node metadata contract.
- `processJson` defaults to `true`. Persist it in metadata only when the value is `false`.
- `inputs` should correspond only to token parameters of the selected business object function.

#### Authoring rules

- Do not guess `businessObjectCode` or `functionName`. Use the actual selected business object and the actual selected function for that object.
- Prefer existing reusable Business Objects for workflow `BO_FUNCTION` nodes. Search/select an existing BO before creating any new Business Object source artifact. Create a new `.bo` only when the user explicitly asks for a new source Business Object, or after search does not produce a suitable reusable candidate and the user confirms creation.
- `search-business-objects` may already return the BO/function metadata needed to choose `functionName`. After selecting a search result, reuse that returned metadata first.
- If a BO was selected from `search-business-objects` earlier in the same authoring turn, every later BO tool call you truly need for that BO must include `businessObjectHint` when the tool accepts it. This includes `get-business-object-functions`, `get-bo-function-output-specification`, `do-create-node`, and `do-modify-node`.
- Calling any of those tools without `businessObjectHint` in that situation is a tool-usage mistake.
- Before emitting any downstream BO tool call, self-check whether a selected `search-business-objects` result for that BO already exists in the conversation. If it does, include it as `businessObjectHint`.
- If the user provides `businessObjectCode` but not an exact `functionName`, call `get-business-object-functions` to inspect the available functions for that BO code only when prior search metadata is missing or still ambiguous.
- When `get-business-object-functions` returns one clear match for the user’s intent, select that function directly instead of asking a follow-up question.
- Ask the user to choose a function only when multiple returned functions are genuinely ambiguous for the request.
- Do not repeat `search-business-objects` in the same authoring turn just to rehydrate BO metadata that was already returned earlier.
- After changing `businessObjectCode`, reselect `functionName` for the new business object instead of carrying over a stale function from the previous one.
- After changing `functionName`, do not retain stale inputs from the previous function. The node inputs should match the token parameters of the currently selected function only.
- Do not invent extra input names that are not part of the selected function's token parameter definition.
- Preserve the parameter type expected by the selected function when authoring each input.
- When using `do-create-node` or `do-modify-node`, each `inputsPatch.<parameterName>` value must be the final parameter value itself, not a nested input-entry object with `id`, `name`, `type`, or `value`.
- When using `do-create-node` or `do-modify-node`, `metadataPatch` must contain only persisted workflow node metadata such as `businessObjectCode`, `functionName`, and `processJson: false` when explicitly needed. Do not put lookup filters such as `family` or `product` in `metadataPatch`. Do not pass the whole selected `search-business-objects` result as `metadataPatch`; pass that selected result only as `businessObjectHint`.
- Use `BO_FUNCTION` for Oracle business object function calls, not for generic third-party REST integrations.
- Use the normal outer `success` outcome for the forward execution path. Do not invent a mandatory `failure` outcome rule if the workflow does not already require one.

#### Output schema contract

- `BO_FUNCTION` nodes have an editable `outputSpecification`.
- If prior search metadata already established the exact `businessObjectCode` and `functionName`, create or modify the `BO_FUNCTION` node directly with `businessObjectHint`; the node mutation tool owns output-spec enrichment when no explicit `outputSpecification` is supplied.
- If `businessObjectCode` is known but `functionName` is not yet exact, first call `get-business-object-functions`, choose the best matching function, and then create or modify the `BO_FUNCTION` node with that exact `functionName`.
- Use `get-bo-function-output-specification` only when the user explicitly asks to inspect the resolved schema or after a BO node mutation reports `boOutputSpecificationRetryRecommended=true` for a non-approval-boundary diagnostic retry.
- If downstream code, prompts, or expressions need BO field names, create or modify the `BO_FUNCTION` node first and let that node mutation persist the schema. Then inspect the saved node; do not pre-run `get-bo-function-output-specification` just to learn fields for downstream mapping.
- Treat `get-bo-function-output-specification` as an enrichment tool, not a blocker.
- When a sufficient `businessObjectHint` is provided, these tools should avoid a redundant BO fetch. They may still fetch remote BO metadata when the hint is missing or insufficient.
- Good after prior search: `do-create-node({ type: "BO_FUNCTION", name, metadataPatch: { businessObjectCode, functionName }, businessObjectHint: <exact selected search result> })`
- Invalid normal authoring path after prior search: `get-bo-function-output-specification({ businessObjectCode, functionName })`
- Invalid normal authoring path: pre-running `get-bo-function-output-specification` only to manufacture an `outputSpecification` argument for a later BO node mutation.
- Do not pass `outputSpecification` for a BO node merely because the schema can be resolved. Omit it so `do-create-node` or `do-modify-node` can resolve and persist the schema in the same mutation.
- After creating or modifying a `BO_FUNCTION` node, inspect `boOutputSpecificationResolved`, `boOutputSpecificationNeedsAttention`, `boOutputSpecificationRetryRecommended`, and `boOutputSpecificationApprovalRetryRecommended` first. Use `boOutputSpecificationEnrichment` only for deeper diagnostics.
- If `boOutputSpecificationResolved=true`, continue normally. Inspect the saved node only when downstream field-level references require confirmation or the diagnostic is suspicious.
- If the node mutation returns `ok:false` with `boOutputSpecificationApprovalRetryRecommended=true` or `approvalRetryRecommended=true`, do not treat that unresolved result as final and do not switch to a standalone resolver. Ask for approval from the host/user and rerun the same `do-create-node` or `do-modify-node` tool call once with the same arguments and the same `businessObjectHint`; the approved node mutation should resolve and persist the schema before saving.
- Otherwise, if `boOutputSpecificationRetryRecommended=true`, make exactly one explicit `get-bo-function-output-specification({ businessObjectCode, functionName, businessObjectHint: <exact selected search result> })` retry for diagnosis, then persist only if it resolves.
- After any explicit `get-bo-function-output-specification` call, inspect `resolved` and `approvalRetryRecommended` in that result.
- If `approvalRetryRecommended=true`, do not treat that unresolved resolver result as final. Ask for approval from the host/user and rerun that same resolver call once with the same `businessObjectHint`.
- If the explicit resolver retry returns `resolved=true`, immediately persist the returned schema with `do-modify-node({ nodeCode, outputSpecification: <returned schema> })` so the BO node no longer depends on implicit enrichment for that pass.
- If the explicit resolver retry still returns `resolved=false`, briefly note the reason if helpful and continue without forcing an `outputSpecification`.
- If `boOutputSpecificationNeedsAttention=true` but neither retry flag is `true`, do not keep retrying unless the user explicitly wants BO-schema debugging.
- Do not invent BO function output schemas.
- If output-spec enrichment returns `resolved=false`, briefly note the reason if helpful and continue the existing workflow-authoring flow without forcing an `outputSpecification`.
- Do not skip BO output-spec enrichment merely because a downstream `CODE` node or other node can consume the whole BO response object. Let `do-create-node`/`do-modify-node` attempt enrichment whenever the selected BO function is known and no explicit `outputSpecification` is supplied.
- Any downstream reference under `$context.$nodes.<BO_FUNCTION_CODE>.$output...` must resolve to a real field path in that schema.
- Do not invent downstream field paths just because you expect the selected business object function to return them.
- If the selected BO function is supposed to expose fields that downstream nodes need, ensure `outputSpecification` declares those exact fields before referencing them.
- If the function selection changes and the expected response shape changes, update `outputSpecification` in the same pass.

#### Invalid patterns

- Invalid: omitting `metadata.businessObjectCode`
- Invalid: omitting `metadata.functionName`
- Invalid: persisting editor filter values such as `family` or `product` as if they were required `BO_FUNCTION` node metadata
- Invalid: persisting `processJson: true` explicitly instead of relying on the default behavior
- Invalid: leaving stale parameter inputs from a previous function after the node's `functionName` changes
- Invalid: inventing input names that are not real token parameters of the selected function
- Invalid: referencing downstream `$output` fields that are not declared in the node's effective `outputSpecification`

#### Example

User request:
- "Call a logged-in user business object function, pass the selected token parameters, and then use specific response fields downstream."

Expected structure:
- `FETCH_LOGGED_IN_ASSIGNMENT.type = BO_FUNCTION`
- `FETCH_LOGGED_IN_ASSIGNMENT.metadata.businessObjectCode = <real selected BO code>`
- `FETCH_LOGGED_IN_ASSIGNMENT.metadata.functionName = <real selected function name for that BO>`
- `FETCH_LOGGED_IN_ASSIGNMENT.inputs` contains only the token parameters defined by that selected function
- `FETCH_LOGGED_IN_ASSIGNMENT.outcomes.success = NEXT_NODE`
- `FETCH_LOGGED_IN_ASSIGNMENT.outputSpecification` declares the response fields that downstream expressions will reference
